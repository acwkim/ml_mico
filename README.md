Code for the paper "A Prescriptive Machine Learning Approach to Mixed Integer Convex Optimization", written in Julia. For the experiments on synthetic data, the entire procedure (data generation, OPT implementation, OCT implementation) for each problem is written in a single file. For mas76 and binkar10_1, data generation, reward matrix computation, OPT implementation and OCT implementation are all written on separate files. For the rest of the MIPLIB problems, only the relevant functions for each problem are written on the files. The procedure itself is identical to the synthetic problems or mas76 and binkar10_1.
